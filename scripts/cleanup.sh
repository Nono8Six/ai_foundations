# echo "For a more aggressive cleanup, run: docker system prune -af --volumes"
# docker-compose down -v should have removed project-specific anonymous volumes.
# The command below is very aggressive as it prunes ALL unused docker data including non-project volumes.
# Consider if this is truly desired for a simple project 'cleanup'.
# For now, we'll rely on 'docker-compose down -v' for volume cleanup related to the project.
# If you want to prune all unused docker data system-wide, uncomment the next line:
# docker system prune -af --volumes || true
